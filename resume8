                        <p>I am a young lady of 26 years old of age, who is ambitious, dedicated, a fast learner and hardworking when given the job. I work well individually and when assigned with a team when given work, also can work under pressure. I am passionate about reading books, playing sports, and trying something new which will make me aware about what is happening in my surrounding nature. I like growing the knowledge, I have day in and day out of my life... I challenge myself with new things and multitasking is what I am good at. I also prefer to spend more time helping people and getting to understand them and dedicate myself in promoting greening around them.</p>
